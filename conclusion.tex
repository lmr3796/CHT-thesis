\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Many enterprises or institutes are building private clouds by
establishing their own data center.
In such data centers, the physical machines can be different due to 
annual upgrades,  but the amount of machine are fixed for most of the 
time.
In such heterogeneous environment, scheduling jobs with different 
resource requirements and characteristic in order to meet different 
timing constraints is important.

In this paper, we proposed a cloud resource management framework to
dynamically adjust the number of computation nodes for every job in the
system.
This framework make decisions according to some specified policies.
The proposed framework can work as an individual cloud computing system,
or as extension components of an existent cloud system.
Our experiment results demonstrate that ...
