CHT-thesis
==========
It requires xelatex and GNUPlot to build.  Makefile is provided.  
`make` or `make all` gives every thing, including slides and thesis.

To have a simple version without template use `make main`.  
To have NTU template, use `make thesis`.  
To build the slides, use `make slide`.  

Output files (`main.pdf`, `thesis.pdf`, `slide.pdf`...) are under `build/`

Some eps figures are generated by gnuplot, from .dat files.
They are all under `figures/`.
