\chapter{Policy}

Here we are going to discuss three dispatching policies --
\emph{priority-based}, \emph{proportion-based} and
\emph{deadline-based}.  Each of them requires different parameters, such
as job priority, execution efficiency on different server and execution
deadline.  The decision maker will make dispatching plans to according
to the specified policy.
