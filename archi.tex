The architecture of this cloud management system consists of three
components: the \emph{status checker}, the \emph{decision maker} and the
\emph{dispatcher}:  The \emph{status checker} periodically collects the
information about physical servers such as whether a node is down, busy
or idle and its resource usage.  Such information is provided to the
\emph{decision maker} as reference for making allocation adjustment.
The \emph{decision maker} is in charge of making and adjusting resource
allocation plans according to the specified policy that takes job
deadline, priority, etc. into consideration; it is designed to be in
\emph{passive mode}, which means it is invoked (by the
\emph{dispatcher}) only under certain circumstances (which will be
discussed later) rather than periodically.  The \emph{dispatcher} is the
component that deal with the physical resource allocation adjustment
according to the allocation plan made by the \emph{decision maker}.
