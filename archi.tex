The architecture of this cloud management system consists of three
components: the \emph{status checker}, the \emph{decision maker} and the
\emph{dispatcher}:  The status checker periodically collects the
information about physical servers such as whether a node is down, busy
or idle and its resource usage.  Such information is provided to the
decision maker as reference for making allocation adjustment.  The
decision maker is in charge of making and adjusting resource allocation
plans according to the specified policy that takes job deadline,
priority, etc. into consideration; it is designed to be in passive mode,
which means it is invoked (by the dispatcher) only under certain
circumstances (which will be discussed later) rather than periodically.
The dispatcher is the component that deal with the physical resource
allocation adjustment according to the allocation plan made by the
decision maker.
