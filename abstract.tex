\chapter{abstract}
Many enterprises or institutes are building private clouds by
establishing their own data center.
In such data centers, the physical machines can be different due to
annual upgrades,  but the amount of machine are fixed for most of the
time.
In such heterogeneous environment, scheduling jobs with different
resource requirements and characteristic in order to meet different
timing constraints is important.

In this paper, we proposed a cloud resource management framework to
dynamically adjust the number of computation nodes for every job in the
system.
