\subsection{System Flow}	%%% [DS] added

Figure~\ref{fig:archi-overview} shows our system flow.
1) The client sends a job request to the Dispatcher in the management 
system.
2) According to the pre-defined policy and current worker status, the 
Decision maker generates a resource allocation plan.
The dispatcher responds to the client about which worker and
corresponding job the client should execute next task on.
3) The client transfer the required data to workers.
4) The client sends tells the management system a task is sent
(maintaining remaining tasks of each job is critical to scheduling).
5) After finishing the task, the worker sends ``job done'' signal to the
management system.
6) On receiving the ``job done'' signal,  the management system informs
the corresponding client.
7) The client collects the job results from workers, and
8) send an acknowledgement to workers after the transmission is 
completed.
9) Last, the worker send a ``clear'' signal to management system.

\subsection{Message Service} % [lmr3796] added
Our implementation is a pure client-server model, which means the
management system and workers cannot actively contact the clients.
However, it is essential for workers and the management system to notify
clients to submit tasks or get back execution results as soon as a task
is done.
It is extremely inefficient for both side and server side to keep the
connection between the client and the management system along the
period.
The connection may last over hours, depending on how long a task is
required to execute (the period between step 4 and step 5).
Moreover, as the number of long-last connections increases, the
connection number limit from the operating system will become the
bottleneck of the management system.

In order to overcome this, we implemented a underlying message push
service between client and the management system to allow pushing
messages to clients from server side.
It is implemented using long polling~\cite{cite:push-pull} --- each
message pull request waits on a message queue which will block the pop
request on empty until timeout
threshold exceeds.
This implementation gives the balance between the CPU cost of frequent
polling and the cost of maintaining long connections as notification
channel.
