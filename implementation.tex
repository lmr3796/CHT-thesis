\subsection{System Flow}	%%% [DS] added

Figure~\ref{fig:archi-overview} shows our system flow.
1) The client sends a job request to the Dispatcher in the management 
system.
2) According to the pre-defined policy and current worker status, the 
Decision maker generates a resource allocation plan.
The dispatcher responds to the client about which worker and
corresponding job the client should execute next task on.
3) The client transfer the required data to workers.
4) The client sends tells the management system a task is sent
(maintaining remaining tasks of each job is critical to scheduling).
5) After finishing the task, the worker sends ``job done'' signal to the
management system.
6) On receiving the ``job done'' signal,  the management system informs
the corresponding client.
7) The client collects the job results from workers, and
8) send an acknowledgement to workers after the transmission is 
completed.
9) Last, the worker send a ``clear'' signal to management system.
