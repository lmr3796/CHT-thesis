\section{Background}

Scalability is one of key characteristics of cloud computing.  To
achieve this, lots of virtualization
techniques\cite{secure_virt_for_cloud}\cite{cloud_issue} are applied to
wrap applications, operating systems and libraries into virtual
machines (VMs) and deploy them on physical servers for execution.  The
number of running virtual machines can be adjusted quickly according to
user requests.  

Placing multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine may
utilize its hardware resource better for the virtual machines will use
the resource according to the allocation made by the hypervisor.
However, as the number of virtual machines within a single physical
machine increases, the resource each virtual machine get would probably
decrease\cite{resource_overbooking}.  For example, if four identical
virtual machines with same priority deployed are deploy on a single-core
physical machine, each of them would get only one-fourth of CPU time,
which makes applications running on these virtual machines perform
worse then expected.
