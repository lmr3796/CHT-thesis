  \frametitle{Related Work --- Real-time Systems and EDF}
  Real-time system (RTS) is different scheme of operating system
  designed to serve real-time applications.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mission oriented.
    \item Jobs are provided with hard deadlines that cannot be violated.
    \item If the system cannot guarantee that a submitted job can be
      done before its deadline, the submission is then rejected.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Reliability-Driven method by Qin et al.
      \footnote[frame]{\tiny\fullcite{cite:qin-reliability-driven}}
    \item He et al. viewed it as hybrid of periodic and aperiodic jobs
      and proposed a method by modeling spare capabilities
      \footnote[frame]{\tiny\fullcite{cite:he-spare-capabilities}}
    \item TAPADS by Xie et al. with deadline and security constraints.

  User utility based:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Libra --- computational economy driven scheduling
      \footnote[frame]{\tiny\fullcite{cite:libra}}
    \item Yeo et al. proposed a framework with linear penalty model on
      user utility.
      \footnote[frame]{\tiny\fullcite{cite:yeo-SLA-penalty}}
  \end{itemize}
  Grid computing
  \begin{itemize}
    \item He et al. proposed a two level optimization --- MUSCLE, a
      multi-cluster level scheduler, and TITAN, a single-cluster level
      workload manager.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item A popular open-source cluster management framework.
        \item Easy to deploy.
        \item Provides an easy to use GUI management tool.
        \item Abundant APIs for customization
          \begin{itemize}
            \item But still hard to achieve node-aware scheduling.
