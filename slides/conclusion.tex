  \begin{itemize}
    \item We proposed a pluggable cluster management framework which is
      able to change its scheduling policy on the fly.
    \item Proposed several scheduling policies for different situations,
      including 2 heterogeneous-aware ones.
    \item Our experiment shows 
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Earliest Deadline First scheduling still gives the best
          performance.
        \item Under our framework, which enables aggressive scheduling,
          the performance of our Deadline-based policy almost reached
          EDF's level while taking priority into consideration.
      \end{enumerate}
